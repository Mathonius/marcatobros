      <!-- <img src="images/super-marcato-bros.jpeg" alt="The Super Marcato Bros." class="rounded float-right">                 -->
      <p class="lead">
        The Super Marcato Bros are Karl and Will Brueggeman. They are prolific video game music (henceforth abbreviated as VGM) composers,
        podcasters, performers, and enthusiasts. Their Bandcamp boasts a catalog of 13 albums, each demonstrating reverence
        for the formative melodies of their youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crown jewel of their creative careers seems to be their long-standing podcast, The Super Marcato Bros Video Game Music
        Podcast, in which they critique and explore VGM in all shapes and sizes.
      </p>
      <p>Mainstream series like Zelda, Metroid, and Super Mario are praised and analyzed. Deep tracks from unreleased Japanese
        games with awkward English titles are discovered. I’ve learned more about VGM (and music theory) from this podcast
        than from anything else.</p>
      <p>
        The Marcato Bros. are thoughtful, classy, and all-around nice guys, making the show a delight to listen to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sat down with them for 30-minute interview (which turned into an hour-and-a-half interview) as they graciously shared insights
        for how to be a successful video game composer. We also got geeky and talked about some of their favorite tools.
      </p>

    <section class="content">
      <h3>Composition and Arrangement</h3>
      <p>One of the unique things about the Marcato Bros is their ability to deconstruct a particular song, figure out how it
        works, and compose original music in the same ethos.</p>
      <p>This idea is behind albums like their Hello, World, which plays like a reverent tribute to Koji Kondo (composer of
        almost all classic Nintendo music).</p>
      <p>More than just a hat-tip to the classic sounds of SNES hardware, Hello World feels like it belongs in the same universe
        and could easily be mistaken for the work of Kondo-san.
      </p>
      <h4>Figure out how a song is played and why it works
      </h4>
      <p>One of the primary ways Karl and Will begin to deconstruct their favorite songs is simply to sit down at the piano
        and try to figure it out by ear. There is usually no notation here, just listening over and over and studying the
        piece until you can identify the voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        All you need is a piano or DAW and YouTube to do this. 8-Bit Music Theory recently released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H__Q6ZXC3RU&t=1210s">video of a real-time Metroid VGM transcription</a>        where he utilizes YouTube’s rewind/slow-down function to transcribe a song. Check it out to see some great transcription
        in action.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve heard Rick Beato talk about this as well, and the workflow he usually follows is this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Figure out the chords</li>
        <li>Figure out the melody (upper voice)</li>
        <li>Figure out the bass (lower voice)</li>
        <li>Once you’ve got those, figure out the inner voices (harmony)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Experiment with spread voicings instead of triads</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">

          <p>Another thing Will mentioned is that most of the sheet music you’d find online for these songs is incorrect, not
            necessarily because of incorrect notes, but incorrect voicings.</p>

          <p>Strategic chord voicings in the NES era wasn’t a luxury but a necessity. Koji Kondo often used spread voicings
            (as opposed to typical triads) in order to fully realize the tonal colors of a particular chord.</p>

          <p>A triad played on NES hardware sounds pretty muddy and unclear. When you move the fifth down an octave and put
            the root on top, for example, it makes for a totally different (and often more interesting) sound. This is all
            over NES-era compositions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p class="alert alert-success">Homework: pick one of your favorite classic video game songs and find it on <a href="http://gamemusic.multimedia.cx/">Game Music Appreciation</a>.
            Isolate the channels and figure them out on piano (or your DAW). Note the things that sound good and try to figure
            out the theory behind them. It’ll be a challenge, but you’ll learn a ton.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Listen to Will talk about the importance of strategic voicings in the Super Mario Bros. Overworld Theme: (17:00)</p>



      <h4>Set limitations on yourself to force creativity</h4>

      <p>Hardware limitations are often a blessing more than a curse, especially when it comes to strengthening foundational
        composition muscles. They force you to explore new ways to express tonal qualities. </p>

      <p>Perhaps no better role model for this ethic are the 80’s-era NES composers. When you only have three tonal channels
        (as is the case for the NES), how do you play a four-note 7th chord? </p>

      <p>Well, unless you arpeggiate it, you physically can’t. So does that mean jazz is out on the NES? No way.</p>

      <p>You can still articulate the chord by highlighting the essential tones, namely the root, the third (which defines the
        chord as major or minor) and the minor 7th (which gives the chord its jazzy feel), leaving out the 5th. </p>

      <p>This is how the great composers of old thought through limitations, and the music didn’t suffer an ounce because of
        it.
      </p>

      <h4>Focus on composition/arrangement before implementation and sound design</h4>

      <p>In classic VGM, what sticks with us (i.e., what we sing in the shower) is not usually the rhythm or the bass groove,
        but the melody. </p>

      <p>That’s why it’s important to make sure your melody sounds solid on a piano, guitar, or your voice before tweaking sound
        design parameters and worrying about implementation.</p>

      <h4>Challenge yourself with different keys</h4>

      <p>We all have certain musical keys that we naturally gravitate towards. Maybe it’s mindlessly playing block chords on
        a piano in the key of C, or never branching out into barre chords on the guitar. </p>

      <p>If you don’t challenge yourself and break away from your comfortable habits, you’ll write the same kind of music every
        time, and it’ll quickly get stale. </p>

      <p>If you usually play in the key of C on piano, try branching out to a “darker” key like Ab or F#. If you like to strum
        open “cowboy” chords on guitar, try some interesting voicings up the neck. </p>

      <p>It will require you to think more, but the resulting compositions will almost always be unique.</p>

      <p>Michael New, a music theorist and YouTuber, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR9MdLkDgT8">a great video</a>        on why C Major is bad. It’s easy to rely on playing just the white keys as a crutch. </p>

      <blockquote>
        Homework: try composing your next song in an “awkward” key (one that’s outside of your comfort zone). It will force you to
        think harder about chord and note choices and likely produce some unique results.
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Don’t skimp on the credits music</h4>

      <p>Listen to Will talk about the power of credits music and its influence on the Bros’ composition style from an early
        age. (8:02)</p>

      <h4>Listen to and write in genres you don’t usually listen to</h4>

      <p>One of the most unique things about VGM as a genre designation is that it actually encompasses multiple genres. </p>

      <p>Within VGM, you’ll find funk, EDM, acoustic folk, latin jazz, and epic orchestral pieces. </p>

      <p>This presents a unique challenge to the aspiring VGM composer, who is often expected to have a firm grasp on this wide
        swath of genres. </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Homework: Will noticed a lot of Japanese composers (namely Joe Hisaishi) use parallel fourths for scary themes. In
          support of this, listen for the parallel fourths in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrSrr3kV8tU">Koji Kondo’s Ganondorf Theme</a>          from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and try implementing it in your next tune.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Karl recommends lots and lots of critical listening to music that’s outside of your comfort zone. </p>

      <p>If you usually listen to rock or reggae, listen to a ton of jazz and really analyze why and how it works, then try
        your best to replicate it. </p>

      <p>Watch this clip of Karl talking about how important it is to critically listen to other genres. (24:00)</p>

      <h4>A little bit of spice changes the palette</h4>

      <p>Will, in a passing comment, mentioned that as you progress in your music theory knowledge, you’ll start discovering
        “spicy” techniques that you can use to take your compositions to the next level. </p>

      <p>I knew exactly what he meant. When you start learning theory and composing, you’re naturally prone to stay within the
        bounds of the diatonic scale (notes that all fit within a major or minor scale). </p>

      <p>The most interesting moments in music are usually a result of branching out of diatonicism with one or more of these
        zesty techniques:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Borrowed chords (modal mixture)</li>
        <li>Secondary dominant chords</li>
        <li>Passing diminished chords</li>
        <li>Extended tones (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, 13ths and all their variants)</li>
        <li>Chromaticism</li>
        <li>Augmented chords</li>
        <li>Modulation<br/></li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Homework: choose one (and only one, don’t get overwhelmed!) of these techniques that look interesting, do some research
          on how it works, and implement it into your next arrangement.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Expand your toolbox, but not at the expense of making music</h4>

      <p>While it’s important to not let limitations stop you, the other side of the coin is to always be expanding your compositional
        repertoire. Some examples of tools are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>New mics</li>
        <li>Hardware instruments like drum machines and keyboards</li>
        <li>Different sound libraries or VSTs</li>
        <li>Listening to a new genre or unfamiliar style of music</li>
        <li>Theoretical concepts (see the “spicy” ideas above)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>“We’re largely beneficiaries of the tools we used,” Will noted. New tools in our toolbox can inspire us in new ways.<br/></p>

      <p>The most important thing the Bros reiterated, and the overarching motif of our conversation, was to avoid “waiting”
        to compose music until you have the perfect gear. </p>

      <h4>Find the missing puzzle pieces (using trial-and-error)</h4>

      <p>Karl, Will, and myself are all heavily influenced by Sonic the Hedgehog series. A staple of Sonic music is the mosaic
        of independent musical ideas that intertwine seamlessly. </p>

      <p>It’s tough to tell where one part begins and another ends.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A perfect execution of this is <a href="http://gamemusic.multimedia.cx/listen/2417-sonic-3--knuckles-sega-genesis#5">Angel Island Zone 1 from Sonic 3</a>.
          Isolate the channels to hear the true brilliance of each part and how they contribute to the whole.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>“So how do you implement all of these parts without it sounding like mush?” Karl asks.</p>

      <p>Well, the answer is both un-sexy and encouraging – trial-and-error. </p>

      <p>Un-sexy because it seems clumsy to try parts over and over until you find one that works. It’s ultimately hopeful because
        it reassures us that we’re not stupid when our first attempts fail miserably.</p>

      <p>Listen to Karl talk about the power of trial-and-error, and the importance of remembering what works and what doesn’t
        when composing: <a href="">video</a></p>

      <h4>Focus less on the character and more on the environment </h4>

      <p>Another page to take from the Sonic series is how the composers focused less on the character of Sonic and instead
        on the environment. </p>

      <p>It’s an interesting change of mindset that one also finds present in series like Mario Kart. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NepeWLuTU">Here’s the icy theme</a>        from Frappe Snowland, one of my personal favorites in the whole series. </p>

      <h4>There’s no such thing as a wrong note (sort of)</h4>

      <p>Context is crucial here. As you explore jazz sensibilities, you’ll quickly realize almost all theory rules are made
        to be bent or broken. </p>

      <p>For example, an Eb is not technically in the key of C, and playing it over a C chord might sound “wrong.” It certainly
        sounds dissonant. </p>

      <p>However, if you take a page from Koji Kondo and use some chromaticism, you can start a melody on Eb and resolve it
        to E over a C chord. </p>

      <p>The context turns it into a playful chromatic flourish.</p>

      <blockquote>

          as they’re released (email form)</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Avoid the rabbit trail of gear infatuation</h4>

      <p>Karl has strong opinions on the pitfalls of chasing the latest shiny piece of gear. </p>

      <p>His philosophy is that you should be forced to work with a limited amount of gear and make the most out of them until
        you naturally outgrow them. “You have to earn it.”</p>

      <p>Karl started with Cakewalk and a humble MIDI controller. Marty started with a crappy acoustic guitar and a four-track
        recorder. They didn’t let that stop them. </p>

      <p>Listen to Karl talk about the biggest pitfall beginner’s fall into: gear infatuation and procrastination.</p>

      <h4>Get out of the box (or stay inside it, maybe)</h4>

      <p>If you compose in the same way every time, you’ll fall into the same traps. </p>

      <p>The Bros are partial to composing on piano, but have also been known to sing their composition ideas (even beatbox
        them) into the Voice Memos app and find the supporting chords later. </p>

      <p>The ideas you compose on guitar, banjo, melodica, mandolin, or electric guitar will all be different. This is why it
        pays to be <a href="#">constantly expanding your toolbox.</a></p>

      <p>I was once in a folk/rock band and came up with a one of my <a href="#">favorite songs</a> by playing the opening riffs
        on a ukulele. </p>

      <p>I never would’ve achieved that sound or feel without the unique qualities of that particular instrument.</p>

      <h4>Find the workflows that work</h4>

      <p>Where the bros (respectfully) disagreed was on the merit of writing on the computer. </p>

      <p>Karl preferred writing straight into the DAW for shreddy MIDI riffs, but Will tries to get away from that, sticking
        to real-life instruments as the genesis of his inspiration. </p>

      <p>I think they’d both agree that each has their place, and it’s important to try to each to find out what works for the
        music you want to create.</p>

      <h4>Performance and technique trumps technology every time</h4>

      <p>Why do we often love live albums more than studio recorded ones of our favorite bands? The audio quality is nowhere
        near as polished, and it’s often replete with small errors.</p>

      <p>On paper, live albums should always be inferior to studio recordings, but we still come back to them. </p>

      <p>That’s because of the principle that performance always trumps gear. Perfect the performance and the quality of gear
        won’t make a difference.</p>

      <h3>Getting gigs and breaking into the industry</h3>

      <h4>Developers hire you, not other musicians</h4>

      <p>Many new composers make the mistake of trying to prospect their work to fellow musicians. Even if you’re revered as
        a VGM composition god or goddess among your peers, they aren’t going to be ones that need your services.</p>

      <p>The ones that hire you will be the developers, so the Bros recommend networking with indie devs whenever possible.
      </p>

      <p>In my experience, some great way to meet indie developers are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Indie dev forums</li>
        <li>Facebook groups</li>
        <li>Hack-a-thons and game jams</li>
        <li>Game dev conferences (GDC is expensive, but by far the best place to network)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Be a joy to work with (soft skills are king)</h4>

      <p>Mindlessly spamming developers is not a viable strategy for getting composition work. Karl mentioned that soft skills
        are almost as relevant as musical proficiency when it comes to getting work. </p>

      <p>This means being a genuinely likable, helpful person, not viewing people as mere tools to use to reach your goals.</p>

      <p>Be communicative, courteous, professional, and meet your deadlines. You’ll go far in the VGM world (or any industry).</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>A friend of mine and fellow VGM composer Ben Burnes summarized the keys success in the VGM industry as “make friends
          and make music.” Check out his helpful video about it <a href="">here.</a></p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4>Do your best to support the story</h4>

      <p>From a philosophical standpoint, Will reminded me that it’s important that VGM support the story of the game. Sometimes,
        a catchy melody is what the developer wants, and other times it’s ambient pads, dissonant choral voices, or a looped
        beat. </p>

      <p>Whatever it is, the <em>modus operandi</em> of the VGM composer (especially when payment is involved) should be to
        support, and not distract from, the game’s story.</p>

      <h3>Tools of the Trade</h3>

      <p>Karl and Will sung the praises of inexpensive DAWs and free VSTs. Why? They eliminate excuses. </p>

      <p>Limited resources also force you to learn more tricks when it comes to EQ, compression, and sound design.</p>

      <p>Here are the Super Marcato Bros tools of the trade:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Reaper // a great, inexpensive DAW used by all three Marcato Bros. // DAW // Windows/Mac // Price</li>

          after the celeste sounds in the Harry Potter series.</li>
        <li>EpicVerb reverb VST<br/></li>
      </ul>

      <p>Remember Karl’s wisdom: when you outgrow those tools, you can expand – but only then.</p>

      <h3>Work Ethic and Composition Philosophy</h3>

      <h4>Don’t bash popular music</h4>

      <p>Will is about to wrap up a composition degree. He expressed disdain for the movement of professors and students obsessed
        with eschewing music just because of its mainstream appeal. </p>

      <p>“They want music to be something that’s only for people who go to school,” He lamented. “It’s infuriating.” </p>

      <p>What made The Beatles and Paul Simon popular is that they figured out how to make something that everybody likes.
      </p>

      <p>It’s truly difficult to make something that can be analyzed by music theorists but also enjoyed by the masses. </p>

      <p>Don’t be ashamed to draw influence from popular art, Karl concluded. It’s popular for a reason.</p>

      <h4>Finish, finish, finish</h4>

      <p>The Brueggeman Bros are some of the most prolific creative people I know. The two have 13 albums and nearly 300 podcast
        episodes under their belts with no signs of stopping. </p>

      <p>On top of this, Karl is in a funk band and Will is in college.</p>

      <p>Their secret to productivity? A burden for finishing. They’re both wired to finish what they start, which is another
        big weakness I’ve seen in the creative field (and in myself).</p>

      <p>It’s exciting to start new projects, but drudging through the “messy middle” is often a grind. </p>

      <p>The Bros have consistently come out the other side and know that the rewards of focusing on one goal to completion
        are more than worth it. </p>

      <h4>Keep writing everyday – no matter what</h4>

      <p>The most important thing, and in my estimation, a large predictor of the success of the Marcato Bros, is to compose
        or make music in some way every single day. </p>

      <p>Don’t let gear limitations, hardware limitations, or time be an excuse. </p>

      <p>We, as humans, make time for what we truly care about. If composing is important to us, we’re not going to let gear,
        hardware, time, or any other limitations stop us from making music. </p>

      <h3>Get in touch with the Marcato Bros</h3>

      <p>I highly recommend checking out the Marcato Bros’ music and podcast. If I’m honest, it’s the only podcast I’m listening
        to right now.</p>
